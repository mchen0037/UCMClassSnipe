On the list of classes on the registrar, you can click on the CRN of the class to access
the course description.

The program will run infinitely in the background until somebody somewhere drops the class.
When this happens, you will recieve a notification that you are able to register.

Ran on VM hosted by Microsoft Azure so that it can be ran infinitely.

command line: nohup java -jar ClassSnipe.jar "url" "course-name" "email"
