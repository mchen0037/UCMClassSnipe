On the list of classes on the registrar, you can click on the CRN of the class to access
the course description. Paste the URL of that website into url.txt and then run ClassSnipe.jar.

The program will run infinitely in the background until somebody somewhere drops the class.
When this happens, you will recieve a notification that you are able to register.
